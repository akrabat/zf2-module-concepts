Modules go here

The module skeletons are:

1. Markdown is a module that exposes the Markdown() method for use in the application
2. DefaultFavicon provides a favicon that is expected to be overridden by the application
3. Example is a generic module showing ZF2's preferred conventions on where files live
4. MvcExample is based on Example, showing concrete examples of where MVC-related files would go.


Use-cases that these modules explore:

1. "What would we have to ask Michel Fortin to do to PHP Markdown in order for it to drop into ZF2's modules/ directory and just work"
2. "What does a module that only provides public/ assets look like?"
3. "What does a standard module look like?"
4. "What does a standard module which provides MVC-integration look like?"
